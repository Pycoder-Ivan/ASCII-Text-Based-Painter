## üìù Project Description
_NOTE: Not an actual pixel editor_

A terminal application that renders its own "virtual pixels", with editing and exporting capabilities. It aims to replicate how a pixel editor functions, but uses its own system for rendering a canvas and storing it in a file. This project is a part of our final requirement for the subject: Computer Programming I. Written in pure C.

## Compatibility
The project is currently exclusive for the Windows Platform, because it is using the Windows API for some of its functionalities.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Build the project using a compiler, such as gcc or clangd
3. Once the binary is built, run the program and enjoy!

## Contributing
Since this is our first group project using the C language, the entire project was not written with optimization and reusability in mind. There are a lot of improvements to be made. Looking to tidy up/refactor the code? Feel free to send a pull request.
